# libvoxel

This repo contains the core code for a simple Minecraft-like game I'm writing in Rust. The desktop client can be found at [WillFarris/voxel-game](https://github.com/WillFarris/voxel-game) along with more information about the project. An Android client which uses this code can be found at [WillFarris/VoxelGameAndroid](https://github.com/WillFarris/VoxelGameAndroid).
